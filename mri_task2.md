### 2.a Description for our representation :
*   Upper plot in the following figure represents the effect of External non uniform electromagnetic-field (EMF) along the whole body (which is represented by X _axis), (Y _axis) represents the range of values of EMF (from 1000 m Tesla: 1500 m Tesla) through different points through body due to the non-uniformity effect of External EMF, so not all points along the whole body must have the same effect of External EMF which is represented by upper plot. 


* 	Second plot in the same figure represents  the effect of External EMF on water molecules through the whole body( X _axis), (Y _axis) represents the multiplication of gyromagnetic ratio (0.43MH/m T) of hydrogen molecules by External EMF ( 1000m T : 1500 m T), this plot shows that the non-uniformity effect of External EMF on water molecules through human’s body.

*   The code for presenting point 2.a :
 
 
import random \
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt \
import numpy as np \

\
x = np.arange(0, 150, 1) \
y = [] \

for d in range(len(x)):\
     y.append(random.randrange(1000,1500)) \

plt.subplot(211)\
plt.ylabel('Bo') \
plt.plot(x, y) \
y2 = [] \

for d in range(len(x)):\
    y2.append(random.randrange(43*100,43*150)) \
plt.subplot(212)\
plt.ylabel('GBo') \
plt.xlabel('Distribution of External magnetic field along body') \
plt.plot(x, y2)  \
plt.show()\
